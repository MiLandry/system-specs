# Spec Kit Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Engineering
Every significant feature or piece of business logic is implemented first as a standalone, reusable library or package. Libraries must be independently testable, composable, and documented before integration into the application.

### II. Strict Test-First Imperative
No implementation code is written until unit and integration tests are authored, reviewed, and confirmed to fail. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly, and prefer realistic integration-style tests over excessive mocking where practical.

### III. Simplicity-First Architecture
Trust the framework and language directly. Avoid unnecessary wrappers, meta-abstractions, and clever indirection. Keep the project structure minimal, and add complexity only when it is explicitly justified and documented.

### IV. Strict TypeScript Safety
The entire codebase is authored in strict TypeScript. `any` is prohibited except for clearly justified, temporary migration scaffolding. Types and interfaces are explicit, stable, and used to improve readability and reliability.

### V. Performance, Security, and Maintainability
Design every layer with secure defaults, sensible performance characteristics, and long-term maintainability. Validate inputs at boundaries, minimize privilege scope, and prioritize clear, readable implementations.

### VI. Developer Experience and Documentation
Project documentation MUST make local setup, tooling, test execution, build, and contribution workflows explicit. A main `README.md` MUST describe required tools, environment setup, build commands, test commands, and runtime expectations. A `CONTRIBUTING.md` MUST explain how to contribute, how to run tests, and how to propose or review changes.

## Architecture Constraints
This project is a modern full-stack web application built with Node.js on the backend, React on the frontend, Material UI on the UI layer, and TypeScript throughout. Separate backend, frontend, and shared library concerns clearly. Use minimal runtime dependencies and platform idioms over custom frameworks.

- Backend services expose explicit HTTP contracts.
- The backend is designed as a Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) layer that serves the specific needs of the frontend with a clean API, handles server-side logic, data fetching, and external integrations.
- View-centric APIs should map endpoint paths to frontend URLs, suffixed with the widget or component serviced. APIs that do not directly serve frontend views must remain data-centric.
- Frontend components are accessible, material-inspired, and predictable.
- Shared packages centralize domain types, validation, and business logic for reuse across backend and frontend.

## Workflow and Quality Rules
Follow the Spec Kit workflow: constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement. Each implementation must be traceable to a spec and task artifact.

- Specs define behavior, acceptance criteria, and non-functional expectations.
- Plans document architecture, tradeoffs, and test strategy before coding begins.
- Tasks break work into discrete, reviewable units with clear acceptance criteria.
- Reviews verify tests, architecture, and alignment with these principles.

## Governance
This constitution is the authoritative guide for project decisions. Amendments require a documented proposal, version bump, and approval from the project lead.

- All feature work must be linked to spec artifacts before implementation.
- Any deviation from the constitution must be documented and ratified in the next version.
- Security, performance, and maintainability concerns must be addressed in the corresponding spec and plan.
