# Feature Specification: Employee Management System

**Feature Branch**: `[001-employee-management]`
**Created**: 2026-04-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an employee management system. It should CRUD employees, make assumptions about what fields will be needed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Manage employee records (Priority: P1)
An administrator can view a list of employees, add a new employee, update an existing employee, and remove an employee.

**Why this priority**: CRUD operations are the core value of an employee management system. Without these capabilities, the product does not deliver the intended business workflow.

**Independent Test**: A tester can verify listing, creating, editing, and deleting employees using only the employee management interface and backend API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator is on the employee management page, **when** they open the page, **then** they see a list of current employees with name, title, department, and status.
2. **Given** the administrator chooses to add a new employee, **when** they submit valid employee information, **then** the new employee appears in the list and can be retrieved by the backend.
3. **Given** an existing employee is selected, **when** the administrator changes their details and saves, **then** the updated information is shown immediately and persisted.
4. **Given** an existing employee is selected, **when** the administrator confirms deletion, **then** the employee is removed from the list and no longer returned by the API.

### User Story 2 - View employee details and search (Priority: P2)
An administrator can open an employee record to see full details and can filter the employee list by name or department.

**Why this priority**: Finding and validating specific employee details improves usability and reduces administration time.

**Independent Test**: A tester can verify the detail view and search functionality without needing advanced editing flows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a list of employees, **when** the administrator selects one, **then** the system shows the employee's full profile details.
2. **Given** multiple employees exist, **when** the administrator enters a search query or selects a department filter, **then** the list updates to show only matching employees.

### User Story 3 - Maintain valid employee data (Priority: P3)
The system prevents invalid employee records and provides clear validation feedback for required fields.

**Why this priority**: Data quality is essential for any employee system and prevents later operational issues.

**Independent Test**: A tester can attempt to submit incomplete or malformed data and verify the form rejects it with helpful feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the administrator enters an employee without a name, **when** they submit the form, **then** the system rejects the submission and indicates the missing field.
2. **Given** the administrator enters an invalid email, **when** they save the employee, **then** the system rejects the input and prompts for a valid email address.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the employee list is empty? The system should show a clear empty state and prompt the administrator to add the first employee.
- How does the system handle duplicate employee email addresses? The system should reject duplicates and explain the conflict.
- What happens when the backend fails or network connectivity is lost? The UI should show a meaningful error and allow retrying.
- How does the system behave when a required field is removed from an existing record? The system should validate updates consistently and reject incomplete changes.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow administrators to create new employee records.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow administrators to read and list existing employee records.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow administrators to update existing employee records.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow administrators to delete employee records with an explicit confirmation step.
- **FR-005**: Employee records MUST include, at minimum, full name, official email, job title, department, employment status, manager name, and start date.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST validate required fields and reject invalid input, including malformed email addresses.
- **FR-007**: The backend MUST persist employee data and return it consistently across refreshes, page loads, and API calls.
- **FR-008**: The backend MUST expose a REST API for employee CRUD operations, including view-centric endpoints for frontend widgets.
- **FR-009**: The backend persistence layer MUST use Postgres as the primary data store for employee records.
- **FR-010**: The frontend MUST present a detail view for a selected employee and a summary list view.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST support search or filtering by employee name and department.
- **FR-012**: APIs servicing the frontend MUST follow a view-centric design, with endpoint paths corresponding to frontend URLs suffixed by the widget or component serviced.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Employee**: Represents a person employed by the organization.
  - Key attributes: `id`, `fullName`, `email`, `title`, `department`, `status`, `manager`, `startDate`, `phone`, `location`.
- **EmployeeListView**: Represents the frontend widget that displays employee summaries and supports filtering.
- **EmployeeDetailView**: Represents the frontend widget that displays full employee profile details and edit controls.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Administrators can create, read, update, and delete employees successfully in at least 95% of manual acceptance tests.
- **SC-002**: The employee list and detail view update in under 2 seconds after a successful create, update, or delete operation.
- **SC-003**: Employee validation errors are surfaced clearly and prevent invalid records from being saved in 100% of cases.
- **SC-004**: The system supports at least 90% of common employee search and filtering tasks without requiring page reloads.

## Assumptions

- The system is intended for internal HR or administrative users, not public employee self-service.
- Authentication and role-based access control are out of scope for the initial feature.
- The backend persistence layer will use Postgres for employee records with a schema designed for the assumed fields.
- Mobile responsiveness is desirable, but the first release targets a desktop-first administrative interface.
- The frontend and backend will share domain models through reusable TypeScript packages where appropriate.
