## Dependencies and Parallel Execution

### Execution Order

1. **Phase 1**: All setup tasks must complete first (T001–T007).
2. **Phase 2**: Shared packages and DB setup (T008–T015) are foundational; many can run in parallel.
3. **Phases 3–5**: User story tasks can be executed in priority order (T016–T051); tasks within a story marked `[P]` can run in parallel.
4. **Phase 6**: Polish tasks (T052–T062) run after phases 3–5 are complete.

### Parallel Opportunities per Story

**User Story 1 (T016–T032)**:
- T024–T026 (React components and API client setup) can parallelize with T016–T023 (backend CRUD endpoints).
- Within backend, T017, T019, T021, T023 (endpoint implementations) can run after their test specs are approved.

**User Story 2 (T033–T041)**:
- T033–T034 (frontend detail page and filter component) can parallelize with T035–T036 (backend search logic).

**User Story 3 (T042–T051)**:
- T042–T043 (client-side validation) can parallelize with T044–T049 (server-side validation).

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete Phases 1, 2, and 3 (US1 CRUD). This delivers a working employee list, create, edit, and delete workflow. Phases 4 (search/detail) and 5 (validation polish) add usability and safety.

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

Each task is independently testable and verifiable:
- **Backend tasks**: verified by Supertest integration tests (RED/GREEN cycles).
- **Frontend tasks**: verified by React Testing Library component tests.
- **Integration tasks**: verified by end-to-end manual testing of user workflows.

All tasks follow the Constitution's test-first, library-first, and simplicity-first principles.
